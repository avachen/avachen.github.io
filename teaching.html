<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<strong>I build on students' existing experiences to help them develop an aptitude for problem solving and scienfitic inquiry.</strong> The essence of robotics is creative, analytical, and fundamentally grounded in real-world observations...
Beyond robotics, a toolbox for life. Where and when do assumptions fall apart, what variables to modify first when approaching a new context or task. How to distill a complex problem into testable building blocks. I 

Scaffolding Intuition

learners are familiar with self-directed materials, such as DIY videos, online classes, and textbooks. Use of search engines and generative AI. But these (as of yet) cannot directly provide informed feedback, only information. The learner has to train their own sense of discernment for whether they are on the right path. The main role of a teacher is to provide gu 

<strong>Empowering students as critical and exploratory thinkers</strong>

<strong>Coherence of STEM research principles and pedagogical fundamentals </strong>
research supervision and teaching development are two representations of the same idea.
