                The Teaching Development Program is a multiyear teaching certification associated with Columbia University's Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). It focuses on cultivating, documenting, and reflecting upon evidence-based, student-centered learning. The TDP Advanced Track offers a teaching certification for attainment of objectives intrinsic to effective learning and pursuit of inquiry-based development as a teacher. This teaching portfolio and the annotated materials contained within are the capstone project for the Advanced Track.

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>
    <strong>I draw on students' existing experiences to help them develop an aptitude for problem solving and scientific inquiry.</strong> Applying creativity and analysis to real-world, data-sparse, ambiguous observations forms the essence of engineering. The dominant STEM curricula focus on teaching analytical and design techniques through lecture-based instruction, which is very effective for teaching how to build things from first principles. But in a world where adapting existing systems to new problems is becoming increasingly accessible, such as with rapid prototyping and generative AI tools, it becomes even more important to understand <em>how to discern</em> how a complex system interacts with the world by probing its inputs and outputs (particularly when adapting things built by others to apply them in new contexts). I am motivated to implement emerging best practices for active learning<sup>[<a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a>,<a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a>]</sup> as an integral part of teaching engineering concepts. To teach engineering intuition, or determining which variables are most likely to be important based on observations, I think about these pedagogical ideas: 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; padding: 0em 2em 0em 2em;">
    Effective learning is powered by students having <em>ample and low-stakes</em> opportunities for self-driven exploration and reflection.
    <br><br>
    What is needed to cultivate a supportive learning environment that enables students to develop a troubleshooting mindset <em>through building confidence</em> in their own observations?  
    <br><br>
    Where can interactive learning opportunities supplement traditional teaching methods, and <em>can existing methods be (re)structured</em> to democratize the curriculum for a wider range of learner experiences?
</p>

<p>
    Beyond teaching and engineering, I think developing a learning environment from these ideas (for myself as well as for students) offers a toolbox for general life. How do I distill a complex problem into testable building blocks? What can I bring in from other disciplines, and how can I communicate what I'm working on in a way that is more accessible to others? When speaking about creativity, Ira Glass said that the process for closing the gap between how our current prototype performs, versus how we wanted it to perform, relies on developing taste by going through a volume of hard work<sup>[<a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a>]</sup>. I believe that the volume of hard work is this cycle of exploration, reflection, troubleshooting; this can only be cultivated in a learning environment that supports repeated and low-stakes evaluation.
</p>

<h3>Teaching Development</h3>
<p>
    My pedagogical outlook is informed by my experiences teaching at a range of scales. I have assisted intro classes for graduate students and undergraduates, and have also run demos and lab tours for elementary and middle schoolers. I have conducted peer teaching observations and have had my lectures formally observed, and have also participated in giving and receving live feedback during peer practice workshops. As a Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) Fellow, I co-developed educational resources for graduate students both within Columbia and for the cross-university <a href="https://cirtl.net/">CIRTL network</a>. Many of these training opportunities, as well as teaching-focused workshops and journal clubs, were made possible by Columbia's <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu/">Center for Teaching and Learning</a>. (See details above in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/#experience">Teaching&nbsp;Experience</a>.)
</p>

<h3>Mentorship Style</h3>
<p>
    Applying robotics concepts to the design of systems that interact with real people and creatures is a highly interdisciplinary endeavor; this motivates many team-based projects as well as individual projects that can be tailored to a variety of students' technical backgrounds, interests, and longer-term goals. My approach to structuring research projects is to identify a well-defined "core" research question that has achievable short-term milestones along with many possible spin-off extension ideas. The goal is to have students exit the research experience with a completed design-build-test portfolio project, while also enabling flexibility within the research topic to hone engineering expertise or explore new technical interests. 
</p>

<p>
    I believe flexibility is also the key to building accessible learning experiences and supporting students, especially MS and undergraduate students who are juggling research alongside coursework and career development. Research is about tackling difficult, non-obvious problems; where and when extensive troubleshooting or design tweaks are needed is difficult to predict at the start. So although I am most comfortable teaching mechatronics concepts, the most valuable skill students can take away from a research experience with me is in learning how to discern the quickest and easiest way to probe how a proposed design or concept might fail first. For me, the mentorship role in research supervision and in classroom practice are two representations of the same idea. I have also taken a similar approach in the past when advising undergraduates, either through formal programs such as <a href="https://www.womeninscienceatcolumbia.org/undergradmentoring">Women in Science at Columbia</a> or through informal conversations, who are exploring whether &#123;mechanical engineering, mechatronics, rehab robotics&#125; is right for them&mdash;the best way to test whether a topic is a good fit is to work on a project in that field and see what is or isn't enjoyable.

                    "Her mentoring style goes beyond simply sharing knowledge—she inspires curiosity and encourages exploration. She has a unique ability to guide me to ask the right questions and find my own path forward. She tailors her guidance to my specific role in each project, helping me see problems clearly from my own perspective. This has made it easier for me to understand my contributions within the larger context and has motivated me to dig deeper to find my own solutions. Rather than giving direct answers, she points me in the right direction, suggests useful resources, and offers ideas to explore. In addition to her technical expertise, Ava consistently fosters a positive and open learning environment. She encourages me to engage with peers, ask questions freely, and reflect on my progress. It always feels like a true collaboration where my input is valued."
