<p>
	I work towards robots that are more intuitive to put on, customize, and operate so that their users are incentivized to use their impaired hands more often and more broadly. My main focus is electromechanical design and robotic adaptation to stroke-specific biomechanics. I am also involved in the integration of adaptive intent detection algorithms that make use of multimodal sensing, as well as with conducting need-finding and usability case studies to have conversations with the stroke survivor community about how to make devices that meet their real-world needs.

			We present a tendon-driven, active-extension thumb exoskeleton adding opposition/reposition capabilities to a robotic hand orthosis designed for individuals with chronic upper-limb hemiparesis after stroke. The orthosis uses two actuators to assist hand-opening, with one tendon network controlling simultaneous four-finger extension and one separately driving thumb extension. When combined with a passive palmar abduction constraint, the thumb network can counteract spasticity and provide stable thumb opposition for manipulating objects in a range of sizes. We performed a preliminary assessment with five chronic stroke survivors presenting with arm-hand motor deficits and increased muscle tone (spasticity). Experiments consisted of unimanual resistive-pull tasks and bimanual twisting tasks with simulated real-world objects; these explored the effects of thumb assistance on grasp stability and functional range of motion. We specifically compare functional performance of actuation against static thumb-splinting and against no device. The addition of active-extension to the thumb improves positioning ability when reaching for objects, and improves consistency and duration of maintaining stable grasps.

			We present the development of a cable-based passive forearm exoskeleton, designed to assist supination for hemiparetic stroke survivors, that uniquely provides torque sufficient for counteracting spasticity within a below-elbow apparatus. The underactuated mechanism consists of a spiral single-tendon routing embedded in a rigid forearm brace and terminated at the hand and upper-forearm. A spool with an internal releasable-ratchet mechanism allows the user to manually retract the tendon and rotate the hand to counteract involuntary pronation synergies due to stroke. We performed device characterization with two healthy subjects, and conducted a feasibility test of the forearm mechanism in maintaining a neutral hand position with a single chronic stroke subject having no volitional supination capacity. Our preliminary assessment on an impaired subject suggests comparative performance in supination assistance between our implementation and a commercial passive splint, and shows promise in improving capabilities of existing robotic exoskeletons for stroke.

			In order to provide therapy in a functional context, controls for wearable orthoses need to be robust and intuitive. We have previously introduced an intuitive, user-driven, EMG based method to operate a robotic hand orthosis, but the process of training a control that is robust to concept drift (changes in the input signal) places a substantial burden on the user. In this paper, we explore semi-supervised learning as a paradigm for controlling a powered hand orthosis for stroke subjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of semi-supervised learning for an orthotic application. Specifically, we propose a disagreement-based semi-supervision algorithm for handling intrasession concept drift based on multimodal ipsilateral sensing. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on data collected from five stroke subjects. Our results show that the proposed algorithm helps the device adapt to intrasession drift using unlabeled data and reduces the training burden placed on the user. We also validate the feasibility of our proposed algorithm with a functional task; in these experiments, two subjects successfully completed multiple instances of a pick-and-handover task.

		<h3>Rapid mid-jump production of high-performance silk by jumping spiders</h3>

				Jumping spiders (Salticidae) do not rely on webs to capture their prey, but they do spin a silk dragline behind them as they move through their habitat. They also spin this dragline during jumps, continuously connecting them with the surface they leapt from. Since spiders cannot spin silk in advance, this silk must be spun at the same speed as the spider jumps—in effect, requiring spin speeds over ten times faster than typical. Past work in other spider species has found that silk spinning rates in excess of walking and web-building speeds (~2-20mm/s) result in lower quality silk and even dragline failure. Surprisingly, here we found that despite being spun at high speeds (~500-700mm/s; 100-140 body lengths/s), jump-spun silk showed consistent, uniform structure as well as the high-performance qualities characteristic of silk spun by other spiders, including orb-weaving species, at low speeds. Toughness of this jump-spun silk (mean = 281.9MJ/m<sup>3</sup>) even surpassed reported values for all but the toughest orb-weaver draglines. This provides the first evidence that salticids are capable of spinning high-performance silk and are able to do so extremely rapidly under natural conditions.
