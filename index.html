      <b>Ava Chen</b> is a graduate student at Columbia University in the <a href="https://roam.me.columbia.edu/">Robotic Manipulation and Mobility Lab</a>, and is working towards a PhD in Mechanical Engineering. She holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where she developed an interest in rehabilitative and assistive robotics. Her previous work includes building instrumentation for measuring limb tissue biomechanics and studying mid-air reorientation dynamics in jumping spiders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ava's research interests are in wearable robotic hands. Her current focus is the electromechanical development of a <a href="https://roam.me.columbia.edu/wearable-hand-orthosis-and-robot-hand-teleoperation"><b>powered hand orthosis</b></a> that augments functional dexterity for individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis. Pivotal to this work is the integration of hardware and software engineer, physical therapist, physician, and stroke community involvement throughout the design process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ava has additional interests in adaptive technology — leveraging the potential of robotics and AI to create mutable interfaces between people and the built environment — in accessible hardware design for wearable devices, and in using robotic principles to emulate and test hypothesized biological locomotion/manipulation mechanisms and strategies.
