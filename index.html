      <b>Ava Chen</b> is a graduate student at Columbia University in the <a href="https://roam.me.columbia.edu/">Robotic Manipulation and Mobility Lab</a>, working towards a PhD in Mechanical Engineering. She holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where she developed an interest in assistive and rehabilitative robotics. Her previous work includes developing instrumentation for measuring limb tissue biomechanics and studying mid-air reorientation dynamics in jumping spiders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her current research is focused on electromechanical development of a <a href="https://roam.me.columbia.edu/wearable-hand-orthosis-and-robot-hand-teleoperation"><b>robotic hand orthosis</b></a> that augments functional dexterity for individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis. Pivotal to this project is the integration of hardware and software engineer, physician, therapist, and stroke community involvement throughout the design process.

    <p>
      Ava has additional interests in adaptive technology — leveraging the potential of robotics and AI to create mutable interfaces between people and their environments — in accessible design for wearable devices, and in closing the loop between bio-inspired robotics and observational biology by using robotic principles to emulate and test hypothesized biological mechanisms.
